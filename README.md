Project Name: Uninverse Physics Simulation
Author: B. M. Sufian Ashraf
Goal: To tinker with a bit of C code and try a naive implementation of Newton's Law of Gravitation.

Warning: User input feature is very fragile if expected type of data isn't given then the program will crash.

Basic Features:
1) Newton's Law of gravity. To swap this, click on 'N' key.
2) Basic planet creation. To create thism left click on "Create Planet" button.
3) Custom planet creation. To create this, left click on and write on "Create Custom Planet" button.
4) Create collection of planets. To do this, left click on "Create Collection" button. It will create 10 small planets in random postions.
5) Reset to default. Using 'I' key. Reset the system according to the given file.
6) Drag a planet. To do this, left click on a planet and drag it.
7) Modify a planet's properties. To do this, right click on planet and input necessary properties (i.e. mass, radius, velocity in x and y direction). It will change the selected     planets properties.
8) Create Symmetric System. To do this, left click on "Create Symmetric System" button.

Basic Keyboard inputs:
1) Quit. Click on (capital) 'Q'.
2) Pause. Click on (capital) 'P'.
3) Resume. Click on (capital) 'R'.
4) Initialize. Click on (capital) 'I'.
5) Swap formula. Click on 'N'.
6) Pause drawing. Click on 'T'. Also, click on 'T' to start drawing again.
7) For writing, only digits, comma and hyphen is allowed; others are ignored.
